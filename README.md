# TetOS

**TetOS** is an hobby operating system that will created (with love) in future!

## Why "TetOS"?

**TetOS** name references an UTAU(A Synthesis Program) named **Kasane Teto** (重音テト) but the actual name comes from **Machine Love** by Jamie Paige (feat. Kasane Teto) songs video (maybe the name is has deeper connections than I think, but I see it from here). I selected this name, because I love Teto. What did you expect?
