# TetOS

**TetOS** is an hobby operating system that will be created (with lots of love) in future!

## Why "TetOS"?

**TetOS** name references an UTAU(A Synthesis Program) named **Kasane Teto** (重音テト) but the actual name comes from **Machine Love** by Jamie Paige (feat. Kasane Teto) songs video, a detail [at start of the video]((https://youtu.be/sqK-jh4TDXo?si=N67gZI-8tJyRWdVY&t=4)) that when a computer boots, its shows **TetOS** (maybe the name is has deeper connections than I think, but I see it from here). I selected this name, because I love Teto. What did you expect?

## Motivation of this project

First time I was started C programming, the real first time was very awful — really awful. I was wanted to make an OS of myself when I started coding, but having no knowledge about coding in low-level. When I tried to learn C, I was get stuck in the data types and I dropped. But now! I have enough knowledge to start (I think) and I have my love of Teto in my side too. So, I can start the journey that wants so much patience and I can fulfill my dreams that I try to catch for years. So I can put down my head on my pillow with no regrets!

### What comes in future?

Future you ask? Heh, I'm not a human that can see the future but at least I'm a human that can have ideas.

- [ ] The first thing is... a bootable kernel
- [ ] And then making the OS intractable with user
- [ ] Making a desktop environment for OS
- [ ] Adding internet connection too!

*And these are just temporary dreams that will come true eventually(?), but for now, I leaving these ideas for my future self. >:)*

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Languages**: C and Assembly (so fun, yeah...)
- **Architecture**: Targeting x86_64 for now

## License

I want to spread Teto everywhere possible in the internet, so you can spread our Teto love under [the MIT license](LICENSE)!
